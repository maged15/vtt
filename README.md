# Velocity Verlet Algorithm
Implementation of Velocity Verlet Algorithm from Lennard Jonnes System.

This algorithm used to calculate trajectories of particles in molecular dynamics simulations and computer graphics.



## To run:
        After compiling <vtt.cpp> file, from cmd or the terminal enter <vtt.exe atoms.xyz>
      
or: From Windows OS after compiling, you will find A Batch file Run_vtt.bat 
      this will run the program directlly where input parameters are listed in the file "atoms.xyz", the first number in the file is the number of atoms or particles and each line is the initial position vectors xyz of each atom.

## Inputs:
There is an input file <input.txt>, this file contains the simulation parammeters.

## Trajectories and the simulation visualization.
        you can un the produced trajectory file by using OVITTO MD program.
